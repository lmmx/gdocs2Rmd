gdocs2Rmd
========

A simple Google Apps script to convert a properly formatted Google Drive Document to the Rmarkdown (.Rmd) format. Fork of the gdocs2md repository — there've been many (180 at time of writing!), and some collation of changes between them could be valuable.

To consider:

* Would this actually be best outputting md or Rmd format?
* What value would code/YAML serve?
   * programmatic access through Google Apps script to write YAML headers based on user input would be a nice way to make Rmarkdown more user-friendly, and perhaps help guide the construction of more elaborate custom knit setups (see post on modular workbooks, linked below).

## Usage

  * Adding this script to your doc (once per doc):
    * Open your Google Drive document (http://drive.google.com)
    * Tools -> Script Editor > Create script for blank project
    * Clear the default Code.gs file and paste the contents of [exportRmd.gs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmmx/gdocs2Rmd/master/exportRmd.gs) into the code editor
    * File -> Save (or `Ctrl`/`⌘` + `S`)
    * When prompted enter new project name for '*Untitled project*', e.g. '*gdocs2Rmd*'
    
  * Running the script:
    - Select `setupScript` from the script editor's dropdown menu and the play symbol button (on the left of the dropdown) to run it
    - Likewise for the `convertSingleDoc` function, or for batch processing on a folder use the `convertFolder` function.
    - The first run will require you to authorize the app.
    - Converted doc will be saved in the Markdown sub-directory, images below that (`/assets/images`).

*NB* don't use on a top-level document (that is, in the root Drive folder). See my comment in the setupScript function.

## Interpreted formats
  * Text:
    * paragraphs are separated by two newlines
    * text styled as heading 1, 2, 3, etc is converted to Markdown heading: #, ##, ###, etc
    * text formatted with Courier New is backquoted: ``text``
    * links are converted to MD format: `[anchortext](url)`
  * Lists:
    * Numbered lists are converted correctly, including nested lists
    * bullet lists are converted to "`*`" Markdown format appropriately, including nested lists
  * Images:
    * images are correctly extracted and sent as attachments
  * Blocks:
    * Table of contents is replaced by `[[TOC]]`
    * blocks of text delimited by `--- chunk chunkparameters` and `---` become fenced as in Rmarkdown, with <code>\`\`\` {chunkparameters}</code> and <code>\`\`\`</code>. Note the `{}` brackets are added automatically.
    * Source code: 
      * **UPDATED**: blocks of text delimited by "--- source code" or "--- src" and "---" are converted to `<pre></pre>`
      * **NEW**: blocks of text delimited by "--- source pretty" or "--- srcp" and "---" are converted to `<pre class="prettyprint"></pre>`
    * Tables:
      * **NEW**: Simple `<table>` processing
  * "--- jsperf `<testID>`" is replaced by an iframe that shows an interactive chart of a JSPerf test. The `<testID>` is the last part of the URL of the Browserscope anchor in your JSPerf test. Something like `"agt1YS1wcm9maWxlcnINCxIEVGVzdBjlm_EQDA"` in the URL `http://www.browserscope.org/user/tests/table/agt1YS1wcm9maWxlcnINCxIEVGVzdBjlm_EQDA`
